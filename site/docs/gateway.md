# API Gateway

The FnKit gateway provides centralized token authentication and routing for all your function containers. It's an nginx-based reverse proxy with a built-in Bun orchestrator for multi-function pipelines.

## Architecture

```
Request → Gateway (port 8080)
  ├── /health              → 200 OK (no auth)
  ├── /orchestrate/<name>  → Bun orchestrator (pipelines)
  └── /<container-name>/*  → proxy to function container
```

All function containers and the gateway sit on the same Docker network (`fnkit-network`). The gateway resolves container names via Docker DNS and proxies requests to port 8080 on each container.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create the Docker network
docker network create fnkit-network

# Generate gateway project files
fnkit gateway init

# Build the Docker image
fnkit gateway build

# Start with token authentication
fnkit gateway start --token your-secret-token
```

## Calling Functions

```bash
# Call a function through the gateway
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token" http://localhost:8080/my-function

# Path forwarding — everything after the function name is forwarded
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token" http://localhost:8080/my-function/api/users?page=2

# Health check (no auth required)
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

## Authentication

The gateway supports two modes:

### Token Mode (recommended)

Start with `--token` to require a Bearer token on all requests:

```bash
fnkit gateway start --token your-secret-token
```

Requests must include `Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token`. Invalid or missing tokens return `401 Unauthorized`.

### Open Mode

Start without `--token` for open access (useful for development):

```bash
fnkit gateway start
```

All requests are proxied without authentication.

## How Routing Works

The gateway uses nginx with Docker DNS resolution:

1. Request arrives at `http://gateway:8080/<container-name>/path`
2. If auth is enabled, validates the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
3. Resolves `<container-name>` via Docker DNS on `fnkit-network`
4. Proxies to `http://<container-name>:8080/path`
5. Returns the function's response

If the container doesn't exist or isn't running, the gateway returns:

```json
{ "error": "Function not found or not running", "container": "my-function" }
```

## Orchestrator

The orchestrator enables multi-function pipelines — call several functions in a single request. Pipeline configurations are stored in an S3-compatible bucket (MinIO, Garage, AWS S3).

### Setup

```bash
# Configure S3 bucket for pipeline storage
fnkit gateway orchestrate init --s3-bucket fnkit-pipelines --s3-endpoint http://minio:9000
```

This saves a `.fnkit-orchestrate.json` config file in the current directory.

### Sequential Pipelines

Each step receives the output of the previous step as its input. The final step's output is returned to the caller.

```bash
# Add a sequential pipeline
fnkit gateway orchestrate add process-order \
  --steps validate-order,charge-payment,send-email \
  --mode sequential
```

```bash
# Call it
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer token" \
  -d '{"orderId": 123}' \
  http://localhost:8080/orchestrate/process-order
```

Flow: `input → validate-order → charge-payment → send-email → response`

If any step fails, the pipeline stops and returns the error.

### Parallel Pipelines

All steps are called simultaneously with the same input. Results are merged into a single response object.

```bash
# Add a parallel pipeline
fnkit gateway orchestrate add enrich-user \
  --steps get-profile,get-preferences,get-history \
  --mode parallel
```

```bash
# Call it
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer token" \
  -d '{"userId": 456}' \
  http://localhost:8080/orchestrate/enrich-user
```

Response:

```json
{
  "get-profile": { "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com" },
  "get-preferences": { "theme": "dark", "lang": "en" },
  "get-history": [{ "action": "login", "ts": "2025-01-01" }]
}
```

### Managing Pipelines

```bash
# List all pipelines
fnkit gateway orchestrate ls

# Remove a pipeline
fnkit gateway orchestrate remove process-order
```

### Pipeline Config Format

Pipelines are stored as JSON files in the S3 bucket (`<name>.json`):

```json
{
  "mode": "sequential",
  "steps": ["validate-order", "charge-payment", "send-email"]
}
```

### Starting the Gateway with S3

Pass S3 credentials when starting the gateway to enable the orchestrator:

```bash
fnkit gateway start --token secret \
  --s3-bucket fnkit-pipelines \
  --s3-endpoint http://minio:9000 \
  --s3-access-key minioadmin \
  --s3-secret-key minioadmin
```

## Gateway Project Files

`fnkit gateway init` creates a `fnkit-gateway/` directory with:

| File | Purpose |
|:-----|:--------|
| `nginx.conf.template` | Nginx config with token auth and dynamic routing |
| `Dockerfile` | Multi-stage build (nginx + Bun orchestrator) |
| `start.sh` | Startup script — injects env vars into nginx config |
| `docker-compose.yml` | For local testing with `docker compose up` |
| `orchestrator/index.ts` | Bun-based orchestrator server |
| `orchestrator/package.json` | Orchestrator dependencies (AWS S3 SDK) |
| `README.md` | Gateway-specific documentation |

## Using Docker Compose

You can also run the gateway with Docker Compose:

```bash
cd fnkit-gateway

# Set your token
export FNKIT_AUTH_TOKEN=your-secret-token

# Start
docker compose up -d
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|:---------|:------------|:--------|
| `FNKIT_AUTH_TOKEN` | Bearer token for authentication. Empty = open mode | (empty) |
| `S3_BUCKET` | S3 bucket for orchestrator pipeline configs | (empty) |
| `S3_ENDPOINT` | S3-compatible endpoint URL | (empty) |
| `S3_REGION` | S3 region | `us-east-1` |
| `S3_ACCESS_KEY` | S3 access key | (empty) |
| `S3_SECRET_KEY` | S3 secret key | (empty) |
